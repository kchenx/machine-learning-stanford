# Solved Problems for Stanford's "Machine Learning"

Solved problems for Stanford's "Machine Learning" course on Coursera.
Each folder contains a PDF of the problem and my solution.
All my solutions are vectorized implementations for greater computational effiency.

Topics include (in order):
1. Linear regression (gradient descent)
2. Logistic regression with regularization
3. Multi-class classification
4. Neural network learning with regularization (backpropagation)
5. Linear and polynomial regression with regularization
6. Support vector machines
